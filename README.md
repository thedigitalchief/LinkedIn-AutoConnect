# Fully Automated LinkedIn Webscraper Bot

## About
  * Automated bot searches and gathers the data of your LinkedIn connections, as well as, their connections (can be configured to between 1st degree and 2nd degree connections). It then analyzes an individual's connections, attributes, and similarity to you. Finally, it asks the user to choose from a list of operations such as sending connection requests, visiting profiles to increase visibility, or just searching for connections using specific companies or keywords.
  * Set parameters determine if bot will choose to send connection request
  * Developed with Python3 and Selenium 
  * NOTE: This program is only intended for educational purposes. I do not advocate or recommend for anyone to use this program on their personal LinkedIn account.
